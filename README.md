In this project, we will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. use SQL to explore the database and write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of the project submission, I will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of the queries.
